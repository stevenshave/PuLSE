# PuLSE (Phage Library Sequence Evaluation)
Quality control and quantification of peptide sequences explored by phage display libraries

PuLSE (C++) is designed to read in fastq sequence data describing a phage display library.  Output is positional base frequencies, as well as protein residue translation position counts and normalised frequencies.
